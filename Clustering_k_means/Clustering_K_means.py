# # Clustering via $k$-means
# 
# We previously studied the classification problem using the logistic regression algorithm. Since we had labels for each data point, we may regard the problem as one of _supervised learning_. However, in many applications, the data have no labels but we wish to discover possible labels (or other hidden patterns or structures). This problem is one of _unsupervised learning_. How can we approach such problems?
# 
# **Clustering** is one class of unsupervised learning methods. In this lab, we'll consider the following form of the clustering task. Suppose you are given
# 
# - a set of observations, $X \equiv \{\hat{x}_i \,|\, 0 \leq i < n\}$, and
# - a target number of _clusters_, $k$.
# 
# Your goal is to partition the points into $k$ subsets, $C_0,\dots, C_{k-1} \subseteq X$, which are
# 
# - disjoint, i.e., $i \neq j \implies C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset$;
# - but also complete, i.e., $C_0 \cup C_1 \cup \cdots \cup C_{k-1} = X$.
# 
# Intuitively, each cluster should reflect some "sensible" grouping. Thus, we need to specify what constitutes such a grouping.

# ## Setup: Dataset

# The following cell will download the data you'll need for this lab. Run it now.

# ## The $k$-means clustering criterion
# 
# Here is one way to measure the quality of a set of clusters. For each cluster $C$, consider its center $\mu$ and measure the distance $\|x-\mu\|$ of each observation $x \in C$ to the center. Add these up for all points in the cluster; call this sum is the _within-cluster sum-of-squares (WCSS)_. Then, set as our goal to choose clusters that minimize the total WCSS over _all_ clusters.
# 
# More formally, given a clustering $C = \{C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_{k-1}\}$, let
# 
# $$
#   \mathrm{WCSS}(C) \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \sum_{x\in C_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2,
# $$
# 
# where $\mu_i$ is the center of $C_i$. This center may be computed simply as the mean of all points in $C_i$, i.e.,
# 
# $$
#   \mu_i \equiv \dfrac{1}{|C_i|} \sum_{x \in C_i} x.
# $$
# 
# Then, our objective is to find the "best" clustering, $C_*$, which is the one that has a minimum WCSS.
# 
# $$
#   C_* = \arg\min_C \mathrm{WCSS}(C).
# $$

# ## The standard $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm)
# 
# Finding the global optimum is [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), which is computer science mumbo jumbo for "we don't know whether there is an algorithm to calculate the exact answer in fewer steps than exponential in the size of the input." Nevertheless, there is an iterative method, Lloyd’s algorithm, that can quickly converge to a _local_ (as opposed to _global_) minimum. The procedure alternates between two operations: _assignment_ and _update_.
# 
# **Step 1: Assignment.** Given a fixed set of $k$ centers, assign each point to the nearest center:
# 
# $$
#   C_i = \{\hat{x}: \| \hat{x} - \mu_i \| \le \| \hat{x} - \mu_j \|, 1 \le j \le k \}.
# $$
# 
# **Step 2: Update.** Recompute the $k$ centers ("centroids") by averaging all the data points belonging to each cluster, i.e., taking their mean:
# 
# $$
#   \mu_i = \dfrac{1}{|C_i|} \sum_{\hat{x} \in C_i} \hat{x}
# $$

# In the code that follows, it will be convenient to use our usual "data matrix" convention, that is, each row of a data matrix $X$ is one of $m$ observations and each column (coordinate) is one of $d$ predictors. However, we will _not_ need a dummy column of ones since we are not fitting a function.
# 
# $$
#   X
#   \equiv \left(\begin{array}{c} \hat{x}_0^T \\ \vdots \\ \hat{x}_{m}^T \end{array}\right)
#   = \left(\begin{array}{ccc} x_0 & \cdots & x_{d-1} \end{array}\right).
